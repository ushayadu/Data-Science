In this exercise I have practiced NaiveBayes model on Amazon Food Review Dataset.Below are the steps in detail:

1) Considered a minimum of 100k points for this assignment as the model runs very quickly.

2) Applied Multinomial Naive Bayes on feature sets vectorized with BOW and  TFIDF vectorizers.

3)  Used AUC as a metric for hyperparameter tuning as its the imbalanced dataset. And took the range of alpha values from (10^-4 to 10^4).

4) Calculated top 10 features of positive class and top 10 features of negative class for both feature sets

5) Experimented with feature engineering to improve th emodel performance.

6) Final Words at the end to summarize the complete exercise
